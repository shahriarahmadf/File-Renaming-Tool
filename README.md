# FileRenamingTool V1.1
File Renaming Tool is a python developed program which can be used to rename all the files in a definite folder into your desired name with serial number on it.

Important Note:
The source folder must be on the same drive as the python code file.
The renamed files will go to the same folder as the FileRenamingTool.py file is.
So it is advised that the FileRenamingTool.py is put in the same folder as the source.

# Uses:
What will you do when you have a hundred pictures of your last tour in a folder all in different names? The pictures obviously don't have a name that sort them in any order. So this program is the perfect choice for you.

You can rename all the pictures in a folder with a desired name format. Say, the images in a folder are named with DSC1293123912391211, DSC123148192834111 etc. You input the address of the folder the images are in as source. Then you give the name you want. Your naming format will be: YourInputName0, YourInputName1 respectively etc.
